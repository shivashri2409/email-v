This AI-powered email processing system automatically organizes your emails into categories while protecting sensitive information. Using a lightweight DistilBERT model, it classifies incoming messages (like sorting into "Work", "Personal", or "Spam") and simultaneously redacts private details including email addresses, phone numbers, and credit card information. The ready-to-use API is easily set up through Google Colab - just upload your email dataset, run the training process, and start submitting emails through the web interface. Perfect for businesses handling customer communications or individuals managing large volumes of messages, this solution combines smart organization with essential privacy protection in one simple package. The system includes everything from data preprocessing to model training and deployment, delivering both categorized results and safely redacted text through an intuitive API endpoint.
